# Img2Tile
A python script that merges many single images into a larger tileset!


Img2Tile finds all images within a specified size range, and combines them into a larger tileset, making it easier to use in game engines like Godot.

It uses a grid to determine the start location of each tile ensuring theres no overlapping of tiles.

Future Ideas:
- add alpha trimming (Remove alpha from source images before importing)
